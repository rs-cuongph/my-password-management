## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### Recovery Code Generation Flow
1. User requests recovery code generation
2. System generates 160-bit random recovery code
3. Recovery code formatted as `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
4. Unique salt generated for key derivation
5. Recovery key derived using Argon2id
6. DEK wrapped with recovery key using XChaCha20-Poly1305
7. Recovery code and instructions displayed to user
8. User must acknowledge security warnings before closing

### Recovery Flow (Master Password Lost)
1. User enters recovery code in unlock interface
2. System validates recovery code format
3. Recovery key derived from code and salt
4. Wrapped DEK unwrapped using recovery key
5. DEK returned for vault decryption
6. User gains access to vault without master password

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Generation Security
- **Entropy Source**: Cryptographically secure random number generator
- **Unique Salts**: Each recovery code has unique derivation salt
- **One-Time Display**: Recovery code shown only once during generation
- **No Server Storage**: Recovery codes never transmitted to or stored on server

### Recovery Security
- **Format Validation**: Strict validation of recovery code format
- **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive rate limiting on recovery attempts
- **Audit Logging**: All recovery attempts logged for monitoring
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed error context for debugging failed recoveries

### User Security
- **Clear Instructions**: Comprehensive guidance on secure storage
- **Security Warnings**: Multiple warnings about recovery code protection
- **Storage Options**: Guidance for offline/secure storage methods
- **Acknowledgment**: User must confirm understanding before proceeding
